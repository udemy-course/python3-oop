Indentation is used in Python to delimit blocks. The number of spaces is variable,
but all statements within the same block must be indented the same amount.

The header line for compound statements, such as if, while, def, and class should be terminated with a colon ( : )

The semicolon ( ; ) is optional at the end of statement.
